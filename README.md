Objective:  Update natural mortality estimates for a suite of rockfish in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea and Aluetian Islands, including rougheye, blackspotted, shortraker, shortspine thornyhead, yelloweye, sharpchin, dusky, harlequin, silvergray, redbanded, and redstripe rockfish. 

Methods:  Conduct literature review for the species of interest. Select an appropriate subset of natural mortality estimators based on the data available for each species. Use code developed in Jason Cope's Natural Mortality Tool to estimate a range of natural mortalities for each species.
