# regression due to underlying heteroscedasticity in the data.

# Gunderson (1997) used linear regression in real space found a coefficent of
# 1.79. Hamel (2015) updated this coefficient to 1.871, which is used here. This
# updated value is based on a log-log trasformation on the regression
# coefficient, which was most appropriate given heteroscedasticity in the
# underlying data. Since M is positively correlated with GSI, the log-log
# transformation forces the relationship through the origin in real space. The
# regression was forced to have a slope of 1 in log space, which makes them
# linear in real space.

# Then et al 2015 revision of the Pauly (1980) estimator that omits

# 2015 estimated the coefficients to be equal to
# Mest=4.111*K^(0.73)*Linf^(-0.333) with length in cm using non-linear least
# squares regression methods. Recommendation to use this estimator IF RELIABLE
# ESTIMATES OF TMAX WERE NOT AVAILABLE.

# I think we're omitting this one:

# Zhang and Megrey (2006). This estimator is a modification of the Alverson and
# Carney 1975 method and is reformulated to include beta and t0 parameters.
# Emailed Jason C 2022-03-14 about whether or not its ok to use length-based
# VBGF k and t0 parameters instead of weight-based VBGF parameters. Jane is
# concerned about using this estimator because of the Then et al 2015 recommendation
# to not use the Alverson-Carney estimator because it has no additional
# advantage over the estimators that rely solely on Amax. Perhaps this
# recommendation is not relevant since Zhang and Megrey (2006) revised Alverson
# and Carney 1975. Also in email correspondence with Jason Cope 2022-03-14, he
# said that this estimator routinely performs poorly
